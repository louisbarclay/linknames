A linkname is a name that’s also a valid website.

### Examples

[will.i.am](https://will.i.am/) (musician)
[del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) (defunct social sharing site)
[last.fm](http://last.fm) (music discovery site)
[join.me](http://join.me) (defunct online meeting site)
[Radiat.in/g](http://radiat.in/g) (musician)

### Definition

- A noun used as the primary name to represent something
- Which contains at least one period ('.') so that it becomes a valid website
- Optionally contains '/' and any other characters that are valid in a URL
- Is a valid URL, if the implicit 'http://' is added at the start

Test: does it work if you type the linkname into a browser and hit enter?

And yes, linknames are [different (although related) to domain hacks](#how-are-linknames-different-to-domain-hacks).

### Rationale

- Platforms (Instagram, TikTok, X) increasingly own the internet
- Creators are highly dependent on them
- Linknames can reduce platform dependency for creators
- Using a linkname:
    - Signposts a website outside of platforms
    - Tells your audience you’d like a direct relationship with them
    - Makes your name stand out
    - Turns your name into a link when used on many messaging platforms
    - Simplifies marketing (name and website are one)
    - Gently 'hacks' platforms which limit cross-promotion (e.g. [Spotify](https://12challenges.substack.com/i/139883573/the-spotify-straitjacket))
- Talking about linknames:
    - Will increase their recognition and adoption

### Hopes

- As direct-to-subscriber models become increasingly popular, so will linknames
- Various linknames will become famous as linknames become more popular

### Types

Strong linknames:
- Used as the primary name to represent something
- Examples above

Weak linknames:
- Not used as a primary name, and therefore often the same as domain hacks
- Examples:
    - Bit.ly
    - AllEvents.In/London
    - Linktr.ee

### Issues

- May not be recognised as signposting a website
- Contain fiddly punctuation

## FAQ

### How are linknames different to [domain hacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_hack)?

Linknames are related to, and can overlap with, domain hacks. However:

- A linkname is used as the primary name for something, not just as its domain
- A linkname can optionally use pages at the domain to form the name, for instance the ‘/g’ in [Radiat.in/g](http://radiat.in/g). This makes linknames much easier to create vs. the more limited number of domain hacks

### Are linknames a protocol?

No. They are a naming convention, a bit like hashtags or handles beginning with ‘@’.

### Why should I use a linkname?

See [Rationale](https://www.notion.so/What-is-a-linkname-Introducing-linknames-8a5ccf70056d40acb04f571c619233e5?pvs=21).

### What’s the point of linknames?

See [Rationale](https://www.notion.so/What-is-a-linkname-Introducing-linknames-8a5ccf70056d40acb04f571c619233e5?pvs=21).

### Are linknames new?

In a way, no:
- Linknames have existed in some form for almost as long as domains

But also, yes:
- Although linknames have been in use a long time, there has been no term for them beyond domain hacks — and as explained above, a linkname is [more than a domain hack](#how-are-linknames-different-to-domain-hacks)
- The practice of using a linkname as a primary name is still relatively niche

### What are examples of how linknames can be used?

Here are three:

1. RandomW.al/k, a street artist who paints their name in a way that makes it possible for people to find them online and connect with the rest of their art
2. Cinnamon.Soy/Latte: a specialist coffee truck that’s been stung in its reliance on increasingly expensive Instagram ads, and wants loyal customers to join a newsletter hosted at their site where they’ll get updates on the truck’s location
3. Wispy.World: a podcast about clouds which lists as a linkname across all podcast platforms to nudge fans towards content and cloud t-shirts on their site

Note: these are hypothetical.

### How do I make a linkname?

Instructions:
1. Figure out a name you want to call your project or organization
2. Try to devise a linkname for it by adding '.' and '/' in a way that makes it a valid website
    1. You may use one of hundreds of [TLDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain)
    2. You may prefer to devise your linkname by starting with the [list of available TLDs](https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt)
3. Check if the domain is still available, and if so purchase it
    1. These tools may help:
        1. [Domain.Garden](https://domain.garden/), to search through hundreds of [TLDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain) for domains that are available
        2. [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com/), [GoDaddy](https://godaddy.com/), [Gandi](https://gandi.net/) etc., to purchase domains
        3. [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/), which can manage your domain for free, and help you [create redirects](https://www.notion.so/What-is-a-linkname-Introducing-linknames-8a5ccf70056d40acb04f571c619233e5?pvs=21) for any pages that would form part of your linkname
4. Use the linkname as the primary name for your project or organization

Tips:
- You can also use subdomains if it helps you stylistically, e.g. [will.i.am](https://will.i.am), [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/)
    - You would first purchase [icio.us](http://icio.us/) or [i.am](http://i.am), and then [set up a subdomain at the site](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/networking/dns/how-to/add-subdomain/)
- You can immediately redirect from your linkname to another website, if you don’t want to directly host a website at your linkname

### Where can I use my linkname?

- Anywhere across the real and digital worlds, provided it’s a place that allows the characters in your linkname to be used
    - Spotify supports linknames
    - Instagram supports some linknames (not those with ‘/’)
